# Simple PHP RDBMS (Pesapal Junior Developer Challenge)

##  Overview

This project is a **lightweight, file-based Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)** implemented entirely in **pure PHP** without external frameworks or database engines. It was built to demonstrate **core database concepts, system design skills, and low-level problem-solving ability**, as required by the **Pesapal Junior Developer Challenge**.

The system supports a **SQL-like interface**, persistent storage using files, indexing, constraints, and table relationships.

---

##  Challenge Objectives Addressed

The implementation intentionally focuses on *fundamentals*, not shortcuts:

* No MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite
* No ORM or frameworks
* Manual SQL parsing and execution
* File-based persistence
* Deterministic and explainable behavior

This mirrors how early database engines work internally.

---

##  Features Implemented

### Core Database Features

* Create tables with schema definitions
* Insert records
* Select records
* Update records
* Delete records

### Query Capabilities

* `WHERE` clause filtering
* `UPDATE ... WHERE`
* `DELETE ... WHERE`
* `INNER JOIN` between tables

### Constraints & Performance

* `PRIMARY KEY` constraint
* `UNIQUE` constraint
* Hash-based indexing for fast lookups

### Architecture

* Modular design (Parser, Engine, Core)
* File-based persistence (`/data` directory)
* Interactive CLI (REPL-style)

## ▶ How to Run

### 1. Requirements

* PHP **8.0+** (CLI enabled)

Verify installation:

```bash
php -v
```

### 2. Start the RDBMS

From the project root:

```bash
php cli/rdbms.php
```

You should see:

```
Simple PHP RDBMS (type 'exit' to quit)
rdbms>
```

##  Example Usage

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (id INT PRIMARY, email STRING UNIQUE, name STRING)
INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, "a@b.com", "Alice")
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=1
UPDATE users SET name="Bob" WHERE id=1
DELETE FROM users WHERE id=1
```

### JOIN Example

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (id INT PRIMARY, user_id INT, item STRING)
INSERT INTO orders VALUES (1, 1, "Book")
SELECT * FROM users JOIN orders ON users.id=orders.user_id
```

* **Interactive REPL session**
  `17- Interactive REPL session.png`

###  Final State Validation

* **Final orders table**
  `14- Final orders table.png`

These screenshots collectively demonstrate:

* Interactive CLI (REPL)
* SQL parsing and execution
* CRUD operations
* WHERE filtering
* UPDATE and DELETE behavior
* PRIMARY & UNIQUE constraint enforcement
* Relational JOIN support

---

##  Design Notes

* Indexes are implemented using associative arrays (hash maps)
* Constraints are enforced at insertion/update time
* JOINs are implemented as nested loop joins for clarity
* Data is serialized and persisted on disk

---

##  Future Improvements

* LEFT / RIGHT JOIN support
* Multiple WHERE conditions
* Query optimizer
* Transaction support
* Web UI expansion

## Trivial Web App that Demonstrate my RDBMS
This project includes a demonstration web application (`task-manager.php`) that showcases basic CRUD operations using our RDBMS. You can view the live implementation through this simple task manager interface. A screenshot of the application is available in `docs/screenshots/task-manager.png` for reference.
